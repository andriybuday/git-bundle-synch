git-bundle-synch
=======
A bash script to synchronize two disconnected repositories via bundle file on a media.

![A USB sharing device with git-bundle-synch running](img/git-bundle-synch-on-usb-device.jpg)

Usage
---------
* Copy and edit git-bundle-synch.sh
* Run from git bash '. git-bundle-synch.sh'

What does it do
---------
* Tries to connect to both repositories to identify which one is accessible
* Fetches sources from available repository
* Fetches sources from bundle file on USB-stick (git bundle file is like a zip file with history and all files)
* Tries to merge these two folders with flag â€“allow-unrelated-histories so that history is completely preserved
* If merge succeeds it pushes changes to available repository and recreates bundle
* If merge fails, you would need to manually resolve conflicts and push
